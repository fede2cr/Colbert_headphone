# Colbert_headphone
Bone conductor headphone, ideal if you have problems using regular headphones

## Description

The name of the project is in honor of Stephen Colbert, who has a similar external ear formation.

This is custom designed for a collegue that has a special formation in the external ear, that makes it unconfortable or impossible to wear all types of headphones available on the marked; with the particularity that it prevents the user from listening to stereo audio recordings.

Here we use a bone conductor, which uses bone as a medium for audio waves, in such a way that the patient pushes the device against the head or skull and hears the audio that is transmitted to the internal ear.

This is just a quick prototype and proof of concept, with the next versions focussing on usability and portability, as well as using a cheaper battery charger.

## Components

This project has no code what so ever and can be put together by just soldering together the components in the BOM.
